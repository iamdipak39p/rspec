## Running Tests

This project uses [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) for testing.

### RSpec Hooks Overview

In RSpec (Ruby testing framework), hooks are special blocks that run at various points in the test lifecycle to set up or tear down state. Theyâ€™re commonly used to prepare test data, configure the environment, or clean up after tests.RSpec provides hooks that help with setting up and cleaning up test state.

- `before(:each)`: runs before each example
- `before(:all)`: runs once before all examples in a group
- `after(:each)`: runs after each example
- `after(:all)`: runs once after all examples
- `around(:each)`: wraps each example for before/after behavior

#### Example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Order do
  before(:all) { puts "Before all" }
  before(:each) { puts "Before each" }
  after(:each)  { puts "After each" }
  after(:all)   { puts "After all" }

  it "runs test 1" { puts "Test 1" }
  it "runs test 2" { puts "Test 2" }
end
